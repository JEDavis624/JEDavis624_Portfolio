# JEDavis624_Portfolio
My work Portfolio

This project is to help showcase the work I have accomplished throughout my bootcamp.

There is an about me page with a quick bio and picture.

There is a contact page for those looking to get in touch.

There is a portfolio page designed to showcase my material.

I am struggling with the positioning of images on my portfolio page and look to fix that in the near future.

I will be making this README a lot better in the future too!!

I have stumbled my way through this but I am not where I want to be with it and I will continue to improve it.
